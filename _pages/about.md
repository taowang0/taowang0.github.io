I am a Ph.D. student at UCSD, advised by Prof. Sicun Gao. Currently, I am primarily interested in learning-based control and optimization problems, with a specific focus on the application of reinforcement learning (RL) in the field of robotics. I am also interested in analyzing the well-foundedness of learning methods in these domains.
